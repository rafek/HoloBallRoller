# HoloBallRoller
Mixed Reality + Azure workshop demo project originally created for [Pixel Connect](http://pixel-connect.com/en/) conference.

Every commit contains work done in a single step of the workshop. Steps are following:

1. Setup Unity environment for HoloLens development
    - that includes MRTK import and setting up the scene with necessary components
2. Create main application logic and prefabs.
3. Do some spatial mapping processing
4. Implement Player and Target logic.
5. Define AssetBundle and implement logic for handling that
6. After moving the AssetBundle to Azure Storage swap the link pointing to it from local to remote.
